	<p class="info"> The Vered Designs professional staff knows how to make sure your remodeling project is on time and on budget. Vered Designs is a full-service contracting company that goes above and beyond in order to deliver exceptional results to clients. We specialize in apartment renovations in Manhattan, joining two co-ops into one and working with new homeowners. We are experts in handling all aspects of a renovation, from the initial design concept and selection of materials, through final installation. We start by getting to know each client’s needs, taste and lifestyle to customize well-designed solutions. We have the ability to source any material and bring in any resource necessary to complete your project. Our goal is to keep our clients well-informed with a single point of contact throughout the entire process. We work closely with architects and interior designers to achieve your goals – so from initial design to inspection, your kitchen, bathroom, flooring, painting or complete apartment renovation project will be smooth and professional. </p>

	<p class="info"> <strong>  Complete Apartment Renovations & New Homeowners.
For Vered Designs the process is personal. We listen to your tastes and ask about your wish list that includes everything you would want in your renovated home.  </strong> Then, we narrow the ideas to practicality and address budget issues early in the process. We get to know you, your family, your lifestyle and how you will be using the space. We are happy to invest the time that it takes in the initial conversation and we have a personable way of working with our clients. The important part about our business is that, as construction supervisors, we aim to eliminate the struggles that new homeowners experience in dealing with big chain operations. We understand, more than most general contractors, about how involved projects of this nature can be. We know how important communication and regular contact is with our clients. Every day, our construction supervisor visits the job to ensure quality and address any issues that may arise.
